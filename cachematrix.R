## Below functions help compute the inverse of a matrix smartly by 
## retrieving the previous calculated inverse if any provided the 
## matrix has not changed.

## Create a special "matrix" object to cache the inverse of a matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        
}


## Compute the inverse of a matrix if no cached result available

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
